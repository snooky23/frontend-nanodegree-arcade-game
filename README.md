Basic Functionality
====================
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won. You will have 60 seconds to reach as manny times to the water. 

The top right water cell is also a button which allows you to stop and start the game.

The middle water cell show you the amount of hit vs win you got. for exemple if you got hit you will lose a point and if you reached the water you will get a point.

The right water cell show you the time left in the game.

Have fun!
